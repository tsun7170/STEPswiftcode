For each test case there are three PDF files and one STEP file.

NIST-FTC-PMI-Definitions.xlsx      - PMI definitions that refer to the FTC and ATC
nist_ftc_suppl_elem_visibility.pdf - FTC element visibility by saved view
nist_ftc_7-8-9-10_assembly.pdf     - 3D PDF that shows hows FTC 7, 8, 9, and 10 fit together in an assembly

nist_ftc_*_asme_r*.pdf             - FTC test case drawing with annonations
nist_ftc_*_asme_r*_elem_ids.pdf    - FTC test case drawing with annonations and IDs
nist_ftc_*_asme_r*_fsi.pdf         - FTC feature and specification index that refers to the annotation IDs and associated feature IDs
nist_ftc_*.stp                     - STEP files of FTC model geometry, no PMI is included

Disclaimer

This test system (test cases, CAD models, model verification and validation results) was developed at the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology by employees of the Federal Government in the course of their 
official duties.  Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code this test system is not subject 
to copyright protection and is in the public domain.  NIST assumes no responsibility for the components of 
the test system for use by other parties and makes no guarantees, expressed or implied, about their quality, 
reliability, or any other characteristic. 

The use of the four CAD systems does not imply a recommendation or endorsement by NIST.

The test cases are not intended to represent best practice in how to apply GD&T to a part. Simpler GD&T
strategies could have been used.  The test cases are intended to exercise valid presentations of GD&T defined
in the ASME Y14 standards.

Usage

The test cases and CAD models can be used without any restrictions.  Their use in other software or hardware
products does not imply a recommendation or endorsement by NIST of those products.

We would appreciate acknowledgement if any of the test cases and CAD models are used.  However, the use of
the NIST logo is not allowed.
